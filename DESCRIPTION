Description: This packages contains some simple wrapper functions to make computing AP Level statistics simple
             and easy in R. 
             get_data() will read in any .xlsx, .xls, .txt, .csv file with only the file name as input.
             get_measures() will allow users to input a vector of matrix and produce all 
                  measures computed in the TI-Inspire used in AP statitics.
             find_probs() will find the probabilities of several basic distributions.
             build_dist() will build a several standard distributions, highlight their desired areas, and print probabilities.
             sim() contains several usefull simulations for demenstations in class.
             QQ_me()
             build() is a wrapper function to produce many ggplot graphics.
             test() Will preform all of the statisticsal tests used in AP statistics, and confidence intervals.
